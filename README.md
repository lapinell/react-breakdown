# React - A breakdown from beginning to end

A deep dive study of reactjs - the only way to become fluent is to read, then listen, then speak, then teach. And you can't teach what you don't know.

This is the documentation of my method for mastering a language - physical (dance), spoken (lingual) or computerized (programming). I'm not a React newb, but I do know that to master advanced concepts one must consistently practice to master the basics. So I'm going to start from the beginning for the n-th time.
